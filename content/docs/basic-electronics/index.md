# Basic Electronics for Robotics  

Electronics plays a crucial role in robotics, as robots rely on electronic systems to sense, process, and act in their environment. Robotics combines principles of electronics, mechanics, and software to create machines that can perform tasks autonomously or semi-autonomously. This section explores essential electronic components and concepts that form the backbone of robotic systems.

### Resistor  

Resistors limit the flow of electrical current, ensuring circuits operate safely and within design parameters. In robotics, resistors are used for:  
- **Current Limitation**: Protect sensitive components like LEDs and sensors.  
- **Voltage Division**: Create specific voltage levels using resistor networks, critical for analog sensor interfacing with microcontrollers.  
- **Signal Conditioning**: Smooth electrical signals in circuits.

### Capacitor  

Capacitors store and release electrical energy, playing a vital role in:  
- **Power Supply Stability**: Filtering noise and maintaining steady voltage in power systems.  
- **Timing Circuits**: Working with resistors in oscillators or delay circuits for timed actions in robots.  
- **Signal Coupling**: Blocking DC components and allowing AC signals in communication circuits.

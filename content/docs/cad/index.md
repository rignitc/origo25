<!-- Summary -->

CAD Designing

<!--more-->


# **What is CAD?**

Computer-Aided Design (CAD) is a technology that allows users to digitally create 2D drawings and 3D models of real-world products. This powerful tool facilitates the design, simulation, and modification of prototypes before they are manufactured. CAD enables seamless collaboration among teams, leading to the development of innovative, high-quality products that can reach the market faster.

## **Onshape: Cloud-Based CAD Software**

![](onshape.png)

Onshape is a cutting-edge, cloud-based CAD platform. It allows users to collaborate in real time on a single model through web-based servers, making it an ideal choice for industries involved in product design, machine parts, and industrial equipment. 

### **Key Features of Onshape:**
- **Collaboration:** Teams can work on the same design simultaneously, streamlining the design process.
- **Document Organization:** Instead of native file formats, Onshape stores design data within "Documents," which act as project-level containers. These containers hold assemblies, parts, drawings, imported components, and other project-related data.
- **Cross-Compatibility:** Supports importing and exporting files in multiple industry-standard formats.
- **Cloud-Based Access:** Accessible through compatible web browsers after signing in.

#### **Chassis Drawing (CAD Sketch)**  
![](chassis-drawing.jpg)

#### **Step 1: Accessing the Assembly Tab**
1. After partially creating the chassis, navigate to the **Assembly tab** located at the bottom of the screen by left-clicking on it.  
   - **Note:** The Assembly tab is automatically created when you start a new document.

#### **Step 2: Inserting an External Assembly**
1. Left-click on **Insert** in the top panel.  
   ![](Aspose.Words.aaa9702c-b348-4c04-9b37-d09a0c872b0c.002.jpeg)

2. A drop-down menu will appear with the following options: **Current Document**, **Other Documents**, and **Standard Document**.

3. Navigate to **Other Documents.**  
   ![](Aspose.Words.aaa9702c-b348-4c04-9b37-d09a0c872b0c.003.jpeg)

4. Paste the following URL into the provided box:  
   [https://cad.onshape.com/documents/692cce191c77a3a06298e5dc/w/aafea05b38b3a608edf34070/e/839bcfdc334e62e3cf4d626e](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/692cce191c77a3a06298e5dc/w/aafea05b38b3a608edf34070/e/839bcfdc334e62e3cf4d626e)

   **OR**  

   - Go to **Public** and search for "**Robot_assembly_origo24**."
   - Select the appropriate item from the results.

#### **Step 3: Adding the Assembly**
1. In the selected file, locate **Part Studios** and **Assemblies.**  
   - **Note:** Part Studios will be empty since the file is an assembly. Click on **Assemblies.**  
     ![](Aspose.Words.aaa9702c-b348-4c04-9b37-d09a0c872b0c.005.png)

2. Select **Assembly 1.** Move your cursor to the workspace and left-click to place the assembly where desired.  
   ![](Aspose.Words.aaa9702c-b348-4c04-9b37-d09a0c872b0c.006.jpeg)

3. Click the **green tick** at the top to confirm placement.

#### **Motor Joints**

1. Hover the cursor over the chassis without left-clicking. The chassis will display yellow borders.  
   - Right-click and select **Fix** from the menu.  
     ![](Aspose.Words.aaa9702c-b348-4c04-9b37-d09a0c872b0c.007.png)  

     **Note:** If you accidentally left-clicked, press **Esc** to deselect. Fixing the chassis is crucial to visualize joints properly.

   ![](Aspose.Words.aaa9702c-b348-4c04-9b37-d09a0c872b0c.008.jpeg)

2. Select **Fastened Mate** from the toolbar.  
   ![](Aspose.Words.aaa9702c-b348-4c04-9b37-d09a0c872b0c.009.png)

3. Click on the top hole of the motor's surface. A **Mate Connector** will appear.

4. Rotate the view to locate the top hole on the T-shaped fastener. Click on it. The motor will align with the location.

5. Confirm by clicking the **green tick.**
